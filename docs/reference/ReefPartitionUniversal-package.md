# ReefPartitionUniversal: Partition reef habitats into sites.

Package for partitioning coral reef habitats into smaller site areas
based on raster data layers. The package provides functions for
extracting pixel points on a reef based on habitat types and extracting
values for eadditional raster layers such as bathymetry. Pixels can then
be clustered into sites within habitat types based on their geographic
attributes as well as additional variable information such as depth.
