\arguments{
\item{points}{data.frame. Contains values for X and Y coordinates, as well as
\code{additional_variable_cols}.}

\item{n_clust}{integer numeric. Number of clusters in result output. Default =
(round(nrow(points) / 200)) (dividing habitat into clusters containing an
average of 200 points).}

\item{site_size}{numeric. Desired site size (area in m^2). Used to calculate
minimum cluster size constraint based on H3 hexagon resolution. Default =
250 * 250 (62,500 m^2).}

\item{x_col}{character. Name of the column holding X coordinates. Default =
"X_standard".}

\item{y_col}{character. Name of the column holding Y coordinates. Default =
"Y_standard".}

\item{habitat_col}{character. Column holding unique habitat values
(attached to \code{id_col} value and site_id values on output). Default = "habitat".}

\item{id_col}{character. Column holding ID value for the target reef
(attached to the site_id values on output). Default = "UNIQUE_ID".}

\item{additional_variable_cols}{character vector. Names of additional columns
to contribute to the distance matrix for clustering. Default = c("depth_standard").}

\item{point_area}{integer numeric. Area implicitly occupied by each point.
Should be in the same units as \code{site_size}.
If using pixels extracted from raster data then this value is res(raster)
\itemize{
\item res(raster), if using H3 cells then this value is the H3 cell area determined
by the hexagon resolution (e.g. resolution 12 = cell area 307.2 m^2). Default
point_area = 100 m^2.
}}

\item{method}{character. Distance metric for calculating dissimilarity between
points. Options include "euclidean", "manhattan", "maximum", "canberra",
"binary", "minkowski", "mahalanobis". Default = "euclidean".}

\item{interpolation_threshold}{numeric. Threshold from where to sample random
points and interpolate clusters for remaining points. This value should be
scaled with reef area for larger reefs. Default value is 30,000, setting a higher
threshold may result in long computation times and high RAM usage.}
}
\value{
data.frame of points with allocated site_ids based on cluster outputs.
\code{site_id} values are a combination of the \code{id_col} value, \code{habitat_col} value
and the cluster allocation.
}
\description{
Take a dataframe of points containing geometries of points and
\code{additional_variable_cols} values and cluster using the SKATER (Spatial
'K'luster Analysis by Tree Edge Removal) algorithm. This clustering is
performed by iteratively pruning edges from a minimum spanning tree based
on the costs of edge removal. Only points connected by edges in the MST
are able to cluster together. This implementation uses a hybrid approach
combining igraph graph operations with the original SKATER algorithm logic
for improved performance. For datasets exceeding 10,000 points, clustering
is performed on a random sample with results interpolated to remaining points
via nearest neighbor assignment.
