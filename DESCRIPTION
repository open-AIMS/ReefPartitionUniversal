Description: Package for partitioning coral reef habitats into smaller site areas
  based on raster data layers. The package provides functions for extracting pixel
  points on a reef based on habitat types and extracting values for eadditional raster
  layers such as bathymetry. Points can then be clustered into sites within habitat
  types based on their geographic attributes as well as additional variable information
  such as depth.
